# Algorithm Easy

A better visualization of different algorithms made with React. Limk to site: https://github.com/Mishalgupta/algorithmeasy

So far there are 3 segemets  
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- Binary Search Game

I have implemented a total of 8 algorithms so far. And will try to add more later.  
ALgorithms implemented yet so far are
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Binary Search
